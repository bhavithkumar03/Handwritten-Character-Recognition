# Enhancing Handwritten Character Recognition: A Comparative Study of Normalization and Pooling Techniques
# Handwritten-Character-Recognition
This project recognizes handwritten characters using the A_Z Handwritten Data.csv dataset. It compares the effects of Global Max Pooling, Batch Normalization, and Layer Normalization on model accuracy. Layer Normalization achieved the best results with 99.98% accuracy, highlighting the importance of choosing the right normalization method.

# Abstract 
Handwritten character recognition presents a challenge due to variations in handwriting styles. This project evaluates how well different techniques—Global Max Pooling, Batch Normalization, and Layer Normalization—perform on the A_Z Handwritten Data.csv dataset. Layer Normalization outperformed the others with a 99.98% accuracy, underscoring its effectiveness in achieving reliable and accurate character recognition. This highlights the importance of selecting the right normalization technique for enhancing handwritten text interpretation.
